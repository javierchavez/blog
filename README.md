# Blog

This is a very simple blog example.

#Models
Simply two.

*  Post has a title, body
*  Comment has a post id, body

#Views
*  ```/posts``` list of all posts
*  ```/posts/id``` show a specific post with id
*  ```/posts/id/comments``` list of comments for a post
 
There is a constraint in place to prevent comments being made without
a post. Simple non-intrusive JS is in place to append a comment to a
post to prevent page reloading.
